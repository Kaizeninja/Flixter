<h1>Why I Think All Men Should Do a Tour in the Military or Work Construction at Some Point in Their Life<h1>
  
  <p>  Growing up as a kid I was very fortunate to be born into a family that was very financially stable. My parents were both very naturally gifted, and so they were both good at many things. My dad pursued a career in finance and mother in nursing and were able to provide our family with a stable income. Growing up I had all of the things I needed, and some of the things I wanted. My grandfather owned a large construction company in the small town where I grew up, and was very good about sharing his money with all of his children and grandchildren especially showering us all with lots of holiday gifts and surprise twenty dollar bills. Looking back on it all it almost seems like a dream how perfect everything was. All of the adults in my life were young, talented, and successful. My parents friends would often visit, and I was always so impressed with them all. Now at age 31, life is good, but dramatically different than what it was growing up in the 90s.

  Currently I live in Nashville, TN and I have been working as an integration engineer, and cell-tower technician for the last 7 years. It is a very construction oriented line of work, and 90% of the people I work with are installers. Some of them are amazing humans, and some not.

  When I was in my early 20s I was completely lost in life spending all my weekends partying, and chasing cheap thrills. This is pretty much how I spent all my time in high-school as well with not plan or forthought to the future. As a kid I was always very talented in sports. I played all sports, but there was something about football that I really connected with. I had a keen ability to diagnose a play before it unfolded, and could frequently predict what was about to happen before it did. They call this "vision" in the NFL, and the most talented people have it. God has gifted me with great foresight and perceptiveness. I can look at the world around me and understand what is happening with great accuracy.

  In all my years of partying and thrill seeking in my early 20s I had completely forgotten all of my natural gifts and talents. Living life for comfort, thrills, and fun will do this to a man. We aren't meant to live easy lives chasing fun, fun, and more fun. Don't get me wrong, I will always spend ample time in my life for entertainment and relaxation, but for me personally I have to be EXTREMELY careful not to let this push me back into laziness. 
</br>
</br>
  So this brings me to the entire point of this article. I would like to partially credit entering the construction field at age 25 for helping me to rediscover all of my forgotten talents & abilities, restoring my confidence in life, and helping me to develop characteristics such as problem solving, resilience, and the ability to read people. Here's why; Theres something VERY good about men & women having to be around lots of other people of the same sex every day. That feedback that you get from interacting with people every day teaches us how to behave in a social setting and the daily challenges & rigors of a job like the military or construction will push you to your limits! It is when we are being pushed & stretched to our limits that we truly become great and find out what were are made of. We will truly discover our talents & abilities IF we embrace the pain for the sake of growth. When I entered my construction job as an apprentice I was completely shocked at how nobody around me was willing to baby me, hold my hand, or just hand me whatever I wanted. I had to earn the respect of the men around me, and nobody was going to carry me! Several ass-chewins caused me to take a deep reflective look at who I was as a man, and set me own a path of growth that I still to this day am thankful for. I credit two of the men I worked with when I entered the job for really taking me under their wing, and showing me how to be resilient, and push through pain & discomfort. Climbing cell phone towers was EXTREMELY hard, and the first 6 months I did it my mind & body was screaming for me to quit because of how hard and painful it was. My boss, was always pushing me to try harder and push through pain. This really inspired me to dig deep within myself and push through the challenge too! I'm not saying I am perfect but now I have SO much life experience from having to work with a lot of other men every day. I have a great understanding of male psychology, which only can come from experience.

</br>
  With that being said, I would like to bring up my final point. In today's society we are extremely blessed to have a world full of creature comforts, gadgets, and technological innovations that make our lives very easy. We shouldn't let these blessings in life completely take over our lives and make us so comfortable that we quit pushing ourselves to become better and better! Pain can be a good thing, and with the right outlook can change you to become the best version of yourself. Don't flee from it! We should all continue to use the creature comforts of life as a tool, and not be consumed by it. We should continue to get up every single morning and ask ourselves "What can I do to become a better person today? What character defects do I need to work on?." There are so many people in America who don't do this! They view life as a vacation, kicking their feet up and checking out through the latest reality show any free chance they get! For a young person of age 18 I would offer you this advice. Pursue a career that is difficult. Find a job that will challenge you and push you to your limits as a person. It will make you stronger in the end! The military or a job in construction is a perfect place to start this process! Don't run from difficulty!<p>
